# Rabies Accessible Genomic Epidemiology (RAGE) workshop  

In collaboration with Ahmadu Bello University and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.


*Monday 12th - Friday 16th June 2024, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC), Nigeria*  
The RAGE workshop is a hands-on training course on nanopore-based genome sequencing to support enhanced canine rabies virus surveillance in a local context.  

Over 5-days, based at the country's national public health institute, [NCDC]([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JCL9Xy9NZ3_kTtE0744eJAaLKgEMXqvWHUJG7V9-ml0/edit?usp=sharing](https://ncdc.gov.ng/)), participants will undergo introductory training in  a sample-to-sequence-to-interpretation workflow, including nanopore library preparation and basic data analysis.

We are thrilled to be welcoming participants from veterinary and public health institutes across Nigeria, involved (or soon to be involved) in pathogen sequencing in their labs.
