# Tree Annotation - Standard


## 4.2.1b.6: Extracting metadata

We can add additional information to our tree. This requires a well formatted metadata file 

___

### Task 1

We'll be using the file `omicron_subset_countries.txt`. You can download this from the `shared-team/Phylogenetic_data/` folder on the VM.

Check your annotations file by opening it in excel. If it all looks right, exit and return to FigTree.

Import the annotations file in to FigTree. We do this by going to File->Import annotations and selecting the txt file we just looked at. 

We can now colour our tips by country! In the side tab, go to Tip labels and colour by country.

___

### Task 2

You can also colour branches according to your annotations. Go to Tree->Annotate Nodes from Tips and select `country` as the annotation. 

Now, if you go to the Appearance tab, you can colour by country. 

___

### Task 3

Again, play around until you have a tree you're happy with. 

When you've finalised your tree, you can export it by File->Export X where X is the file type. 

___

### Task 4


Now try to annotate your tree in FigTree with tips coloured by year using the metadata file 'omicron_subset_countries_years.txt'

___


### Task 5

Finally, try to annotate your tree in FigTree with tips coloured by whether the sequence is from the Philippines (PHL) or not! Use the metadata file 'omicron_subset_countries_PHLOther.txt'.
